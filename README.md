# C-Library-on-Linear-Algebra

This mini-project was created during one of my courses on Algorithms.
It consists of all the Linear Algebra Functions that can be used by just calling out the function. The functions that have been added to this library are:
  1. Echleon Form - Converts the input matrix to its echleon form.
  2. Gauss Elimination Form - Carries out gauss elimination the input matrix.
  3. Gauss Jordan Method - Finds the inverse of a matrix using the Gauss Jordan Method.
  4. Transpose, Rank and Orthogonality - Finds the Transpose, Rank and Orthogonality of the input matrix.
  5. Rayleigh Power Method - This method is used to find the dominant eigen vector and the dominant eigen value of the matrix.
  6. LU Decomposition - This method factors the input matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix.
